## 1. Purpose

The function <i>retrieve_tensor</i> is used to retrieve the diffusion tensor from a matrix of diffusion tensors.

## 2. Usage
The user does not interact with this function; it is called from within the <i>fiber_track</i> function.

## 3. Syntax
d_tensor = retrieve_tensor(tensor_m, img_indx);

The input arguments are:

* <i>tensor_m</i>: A 5D matrix with the first-third dimensions matching the [rows columns slice] size of the DTI images and the fourth and fifth dimensions holding the 3ï‚´3 diffusion tensor at each voxel.

* <i>img_indx</i> The row, column, and slice indices into the tensor_m matrix.

The output argument is:

* <i>d_tensor</i>: The diffusion tensor.

## 4. Example Code
An example is not given because the function is called from within <i>fiber_track</i>. The user does not interact with this function.
