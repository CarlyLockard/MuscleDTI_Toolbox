## 1. Usage
The function fiber_selector is used to sample from a set of quantified fiber tracts geerated using the MuscleDTI_Toolbox in a way that uniformly and optimally characterizes the muscle's architectural properties. A two stage selection process is used:

  1. First, the quality algorithm described in Heemskerk et al, 2008 is implemented; however it has been updated in several ways. Specifically, the fiber tracts are selected for having:

     a. Monotonically increasing values in the Z direction. This prevents errors due to overfitting in the Z direction; 
   
   * A reasonable minimum length (in mm, specified by the user based on their knowledge of the expected muscle geometry);
   
   * A reasonable range of pennation angles (in degrees, specified by user based on their knowledge of the expected muscle geometry);
   
   * A reasonable maximum curvature value (in m^-1, specified by user based on their knowledge of the expected muscle geometry); and
   
   * Values that lie within the 95% confidence interval for length, pennation angle, and curvature set by the surrounding 24 tracts.

  
## 2. Syntax
 [final_fibers, final_curvature, final_angle, final_distance, qual_mask, num_tracked, mean_fiber_properties, mean_apo_properties] = ...
 
   fiber_selector(fitted_fiber_all, angle_list, distance_list, curvature_list, n_points, apo_area, roi_flag, fs_options)

## 3. Input Arguments
 * <i>fitted_fiber_all</i>: the smoothed fiber tracts

 * <i>angle_list</i>: pennation angles for smoothed fiber tracts 

 * <i>distance_list</i>: distance measures for smoothed fiber tracts 

 * <i>curvature_list</i>: curvature measures for smoothed fiber tracts 

 * <i>n_points</i>: the number of points quantified per fiber tract 

 * <i>apo_area</i>: a matrix indicating the amount of aponeurosis area associated with each fiber tract

 * <i>roi_flag</i>: a mask indicating fiber tracts that propagated at least one point in the function fiber_track.

 * <i>fs_options</i>: a structure containing user-specified criteria for rejecting tracts:
     min_distance: minimum distance for selected tracts, in mm
     min_pennation: minimum pennation angle, in degrees 
     max_pennation: maximum pennation angle, in degrees 
     max_curvature: maximum curvature, in m^-1

## 4. Output Arguments
 * <i>final_fibers</i>: the fiber tracts that passed all selection criteria

 * <i>final_curvature</i>: pointwise measurements of curvature for the final tracts.

 * <i>final_angle</i>: pointwise measurements of pennation angle for the final tracts.

 * <i>final_distance</i>: pointwise measurements of cumulative distance for the final tracts

 * <i>qual_mask</i>: a 3D matrix of the same row x column size as the roi_mesh, with 6 layers corresponding to each stage of the selection process. In each layer, ones correspond to retained fibers and zeros correspond to rejected fibers

 * <i>num_tracked</i>: the number of fibers for each of the following steps:
   1) the number of potential fiber tracts;
   2) the number of these tracts generated by fiber_track;
   3-7) the number of fiber tracts that met criteria 1-5 above, respectively.

 * <i>mean_fiber_properties</i>: A 3D matrix (rows x columns x 5) containing the mean curvature, pennation, and length values along each of the tracts; the amount of aponeurosis area represented by each tract; and the number of points in each tract

 * <i>mean_apo_properties</i>: A 1 x 3 vector containing the whole-muscle mean values for curvature, pennation, and fiber tract length, weighted by the amount of aponeurosis area represented by each tract.
