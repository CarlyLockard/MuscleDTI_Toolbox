Help for <i>signal2tensor2</i>, v. 1.0

d_m = signal2tensor2(signal_v, dir_m, b)
USAGE
signal2tensor2 finds the tensor that best fits the observed signal.
The user inputs a column vector containing unweighted and diffusion-
weighted signals, a matrix describing the diffusion-sensitizing 
directions; and the b-value (assumed to be the same for all directions).
The function outputs the calculated tensor, with units of 1/[b]. 
INPUT ARGUMENTS
signal_v: A column vector of image signals, the first element of which is
the unweighted signal, and the other elements of which correspond to the
directions specified by the rows of dir_m 

dir_m: A matrix containing the X, Y, and Z components of unit-length vectors 
describing the diffusion-sensitizing directions; it has dimensions of
(Number of Directions x 3)

b: The diffusion-weighting (b-) value

OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
d_m: The diffusion tensor.
