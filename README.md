# MuscleDTI_Toolbox
A Matlab Toolbox for Skeletal Muscle Diffusion Tensor MRI Fiber Tractography 
  The MuscleDTI_Toolbox consists of a series of custom-written Matlab functions for performing diffusion-tensor MRI fiber tractography in skeletal muscle. The toolbox consists of:
  1) General recommendations for acquiring data, as well as the conventions assumed in processing the data;
  2) A sample script for pre-processing the data;
  3) Functions for generating and quantifying the fiber tracts and a sample script that calls the functions.
