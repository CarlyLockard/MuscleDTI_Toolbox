# Workflow Improvements
## Pre-processing Steps 
* Increasing the robustness of DT image mask generation and image registration routines 

## Fiber-tract Processing Steps
Automating the definition of muscle boundaries in define_muscle
Enacting algorithm changes to <i>define_roi</i> that improve the agreement between the initial and final aponeurosis segmentations
Creating a graphical user interface. 

# New Features 
## Pre-processing Steps 
* Adding options for estimating the diffusion tensor, include other least squares methods, incorporation of b-matrices and multiple b-values into diffusion tensor estimation, and techniques such as RESTORE 
* Example code for import/export or NIfTI files
* Importation of masks drawn using other software
* Image averaging within MATLAB

## Fiber-tract Processing Steps
* Improved interpolation of the diffusion tensor during fiber-tracking
* Objective determination of polynomial order for fiber-tract smoothing
* Computing muscle architecture during contraction
* Relating spatial maps of strain, muscle damage biomarkers, and other variables to the underlying architecture at the level of individual fiber-tract
